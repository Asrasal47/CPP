Description
The course is broken into four phases, each of which lasts approximately one month. Phase I will give you a grounding in the basics of Object Oriented Programming and the C++ language. Phase II will introduce Java® and some of the basic algorithms and data structures, such as arrays, trees, searching, sorting, geometric reasoning etc. Phase III will introduce the Java® programming language, which will be used for your term projects. Phase IV will be a final project to give you a chance to put your new knowledge into practice on a challenging project. The project this year will focus on building a simulation to demonstrate a physical principle of your choice.

In summary:

Phase I: C++ and OOP
Covers classes and objects, inheritance, virtual functions, abstract classes, polymorphism

Phase II: Algorithms
Searching and sorting methods

Phase III: Java®
Java applications and applets, Abstract Windowing Toolkit, Graphics, Image Processing, Threads. Integrating Java ®and C++.

Phase IV: Project
Selected advanced topics in Java® and C++. Simulation (term project) using Java® and/or C++.
